This plugin allows you to modify the flying speed of yourself and other players on your server. Simple as.

## Rationale:
When working on large maps, I found the default flying speed to be a constant frustration. I created this plugin because I couldn't find a lightweight, simple, non-legacy plugin that offers this functionality.

## Commands:
- `/fs <number> (player)` (aliases: `/flyspeed`, `/fly-speed`) - modifies the fly speed of a player. if no player is specified, it will modify your own fly speed
> `number` can be any non-whole number between -10 & 10

## Permissions:
- `fs.use` - allows running the `/fs` command
- `fs.others` - allows modifying the flying speed of other players
